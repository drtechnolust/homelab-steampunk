# üöÄ SteamPunk Homelab

Welcome to my cyberpunk-themed homelab ‚Äî a playground where learning, automation, and entertainment collide.  
Powered by Unraid, Docker, and secured through Traefik and Cloudflare Tunnels, this environment balances serious production reliability with a spirit of experimentation.

> "It's not just a homelab ‚Äî it's a lifestyle."

## üõ°Ô∏è Principles

- **Containerization First**: All services are deployed in isolated containers to ensure modularity, resilience, and effortless scalability.
- **Secure Ingress and Traffic Control**: All inbound and internal traffic is dynamically routed with SSL encryption, strict routing policies, and minimal attack surface exposure.
- **Identity and Access Governance**: Centralized authentication and fine-grained access controls are enforced across all services, ensuring that only trusted identities gain appropriate access to protected resources.
- **Zero-Trust External Access**: External connectivity operates under a zero-trust model, leveraging encrypted tunnels and forward authentication to prevent unauthorized entry.
- **Resilient Storage Architecture**: Storage combines fast NVMe caching with a robust hard drive array to balance performance, redundancy, and expansion without compromising data integrity.
- **Holistic System Monitoring and Automation**: System health, automation, and backup processes are fully integrated across storage and service layers to ensure uptime, efficiency, and rapid recovery capabilities.
- **Open-Source Ethos**: The environment is designed around open-source solutions, prioritizing transparency, adaptability, and community-driven innovation.
- **Continuous Optimization and Fortification**: All systems undergo continuous evaluation and refinement to improve performance, bolster security, and integrate the latest technological advancements.
- **Purpose-Driven Design**: Every deployed component is selected based on long-term reliability, operational excellence, and alignment with the homelab‚Äôs evolving mission.
